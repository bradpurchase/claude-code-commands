Use the gh CLI to create a Github Pull Request. If available, adhere to the template in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md.

Keep the description concise and informative. There typically isn't a need to describe every single change made in the pull request; instead, distill the changes down to a few key points that are critical to understanding the changes.

Once the pull request has been created, provide a link to it so the user can easily view it in their browser.
